## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of Python development

### First Steps

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/reviewlab.git
   cd reviewlab
   ```
3. **Set up the development environment** (see Development Setup below)
4. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Setup

### 1. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install production dependencies
pip install -e .

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### 3. Install Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
make install-hooks
```

### 4. Verify Setup

```bash
# Run tests to ensure everything works
make test

# Check code quality
make quality-check
```

## Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

### Python Code Style

- **Black**: Code formatting (line length: 100)
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **flake8**: Linting
- **mypy**: Type checking

### Running Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Format code
make format

# Check formatting
make format-check

# Run linting
make lint

# Run type checking
make type-check

# Run all quality checks
make quality-check
```

### Code Style Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 (with Black formatting)
- Use type hints for all functions
- Write docstrings for all public functions
- Keep functions under 20 lines when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Example

```python
from typing import List, Optional
from pathlib import Path

def process_files(file_paths: List[Path], output_dir: Optional[Path] = None) -> bool:
    """
    Process a list of files and optionally save results to output directory.
    
    Args:
        file_paths: List of file paths to process
        output_dir: Optional output directory for results
        
    Returns:
        True if processing succeeded, False otherwise
        
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If any input file doesn't exist
        PermissionError: If output directory is not writable
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-cov

# Run tests quickly
make test-fast

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_bug_injection.py -v

# Run tests matching pattern
python -m pytest -k "test_inject_bug" -v
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and failure cases

### Example Test

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from core.bug_injection import BugInjectionEngine

class TestBugInjection:
    """Test bug injection functionality."""
    
    def test_inject_bug_success(self):
        """Test successful bug injection."""
        # Arrange
        engine = BugInjectionEngine(Path("."))
        template_id = "test_template"
        file_path = "test.py"
        line_number = 10
        
        # Act
        result = engine.inject_bug(template_id, file_path, line_number)
        
        # Assert
        assert result.success is True
        assert result.modifications is not None
        assert len(result.modifications) > 0
```

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Prepare Your Changes

- Ensure all tests pass: `make test`
- Run code quality checks: `make quality-check`
- Update documentation if needed
- Add tests for new functionality

### 2. Commit Your Changes

Use conventional commit messages:

```bash
# Format: type(scope): description
git commit -m "feat(bug-injection): add support for custom bug patterns"

# Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
# Scopes: bug-injection, evaluation, cli, core, etc.
```

### 3. Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:

- **Clear title** describing the change
- **Detailed description** of what was changed and why
- **Screenshots** if UI changes were made
- **Test instructions** for reviewers
- **Related issues** if applicable

### 4. PR Review Process

- All PRs require at least one review
- Address review comments promptly
- Maintainers may request changes
- Once approved, maintainers will merge
